# Uel Adams DND Tool

Run a DND Character from Python. For now, you can roll dice, cast spells, make an ability or save throw, view Uel's modifiers, and attack. 
Line 6 will need to be modified to reflect the location of the "UelAdams.txt" file. 

This tool was designed with my specific DND character in mind. You are welcome to reverse-engineer the code and fit it to your liking. I'd love to see what you do with it.
